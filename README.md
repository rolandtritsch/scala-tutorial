My Scala Tutorial(s)
=====================

Various short Scala apps to play with Scala.

To make it work install Scala and Sbt (using macports) ...

> sudo port install scala
> sudo port install sbt

... and run then run sbt ...

> sbt clean compile run

... and select to run HelloWorld (normally [5]).

To run the examples that need arguments you need 
to start/run sbt and at the prompt need to type 
run followed by the parameters, e.g. to run Fib ...

>> run 10

... and select Fib.
